    "## Business understanding\n",
    "Water is a basic need and right for all human beings and access to clean and safe water remains a significant challenge in Tanzania, a country with a population exceeding 57 million people. While thousands of water points (wells and pumps) have been installed across the nation, not all of them function reliably. Many are partially functional, in need of repair, or completely non-functional. This undermines efforts to provide consistent access to water, particularly in rural areas. Using data on pump type, installation year, geographic location, and other related attributes, we can build a predictive model that classifies the condition of a water well. Such a system would help prioritize repairs, allocate resources effectively, and guide future infrastructure investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "The traditional model for water infrastructure management in Tanzania is reactive: a pump is serviced or repaired only after it has completely failed. This approach is inherently inefficient and costly, leading to prolonged periods without access to water for communities and significant expense for emergency repairs\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is determined to build predictive model that represents a fundamental paradigm shift to proactive and data driven maintenance. and by leveraging historical data and machine learning, the model can anticipate which water points are at risk of failure or are already in a state of disrepair, enabling maintenance crews to intervene before a complete breakdown occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "The most critical and actionable objective of this project is to:\n",
    "* Accurately identify water points that are currently functional but need repair\n",
    "* Identify patterns in non-functional wells to inform better design, placement, and maintenance of new water points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics of success\n",
    "The success of the model will be evaluated using classification metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy\n",
    "* precision and recall\n",
    "* F1 score\n",
    "* Confusion matrix"
